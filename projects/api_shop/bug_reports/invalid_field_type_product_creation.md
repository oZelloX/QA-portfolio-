**Expected Result:**

- Response should be in JSON format, with a clear error message (e.g., "price" must be a number)

---

**Actual Result:**  
- Status code: **200 OK**  
- Response is returned as an HTML error page:   

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>Bad Request</pre>
</body>
</html>

**Notes:**  
- API does not validate input types correctly or handle errors in a structured, client-friendly JSON format.
- HTML response is not suitable for API consumers and violates RESTful API best practices.
- Input validation for required types is critical for API reliability and client integration.
