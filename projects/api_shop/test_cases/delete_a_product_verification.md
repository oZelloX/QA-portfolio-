  "rating": {
    "rate": 3,
    "count": 400
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- This test verifies whether the product was actually deleted after a DELETE request.
- fakestoreapi returns a static product object with status 200 OK, meaning the product still exists.
- This confirms that the DELETE operation is non-functional in fakestoreapi.
- The test is retained to document full coverage and highlight API limitations.
