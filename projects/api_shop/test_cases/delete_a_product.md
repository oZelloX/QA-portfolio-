**Expected Result:**  
- Status code: **200 OK**  
- Response is a JSON object containing the following fields:
 
```json
{
 "id": 7,
 "title": "White Gold Plated Princess",
 "price": 9.99,
 "description": "Classic Created Wedding Engagement Solitaire Diamond Promise Ring for Her. Gifts to spoil your love more for Engagement, Wedding, Anniversary, Valentine's Day...",
 "category": "jewelery",
 "image": "https://fakestoreapi.com/img/71YAIFU48IL._AC_UL640_QL65_ML3_.jpg"
}
```
---

**Actual Result:**  
- Status code: **200 OK**  
- Response body:
```json
{
    "id": 7,
    "title": "White Gold Plated Princess",
    "price": 9.99,
    "description": "Classic Created Wedding Engagement Solitaire Diamond Promise Ring for Her. Gifts to spoil your love more for Engagement, Wedding, Anniversary, Valentine's Day...",
    "category": "jewelery",
    "image": "https://fakestoreapi.com/img/71YAIFU48IL._AC_UL640_QL65_ML3_.jpg",
    "rating": {
        "rate": 3,
        "count": 400
    }
}
```
---

**Notes:**  
- fakestoreapi returns a static response even for DELETE requests.
- The field `rating` is present in the actual response but not documented.
- The expected result was based on a preliminary GET request to `/products/7` to reflect the actual stored data.
- JSON object key order and presence of undocumented fields may vary; this is not a defect.
