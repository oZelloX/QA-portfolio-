**Test Steps:**

1. Open Postman  
2. Set method to **PUT**  
3. Enter URL: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products/5`
4. In **Body** tab, select **raw** and format **JSON**  
5. Paste the following request body:
```json
{
 "title": "USB Flash drive",
 "price": 50.55,
 "description": "The best USB Flash Drive",
 "image": "http://example.com",
 "category": "Computer"
}
```
6. Click **Send**

---

**Expected Result:**  
- Status code: **200 OK**  
- Response is a JSON object containing the following fields:
 
```json
{
 "id": 5,
 "title": "USB Flash drive",
 "price": 50.55,
 "description": "The best USB Flash Drive",
 "image": "http://example.com",
 "category": "Computer"
}
```
---

**Actual Result:**  
- Status code: **200 OK**  
- Response body:
  
```json
{
 "id": 5,
 "title": "USB Flash drive",
 "price": 50.55,
 "description": "The best USB Flash Drive",
 "category": "Computer",
 "image": "http://example.com"
}
```
---

**Notes:**  
- The request body was composed according to the API documentation.
- The expected result assumes that the server updates and returns the modified data.
- However, fakestoreapi returns a static predefined object, regardless of the request body.
- The field order in the response may differ; this is normal behavior in JSON and not a defect.
