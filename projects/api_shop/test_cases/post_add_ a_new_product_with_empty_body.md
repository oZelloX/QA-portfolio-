**Test Steps:**

1. Open Postman  
2. Set method to **POST**  
3. Enter URL: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`  
4. In the **Body** tab, select **raw**, format **JSON**, and leave body empty
5. Click **Send**

---

**Expected Result:**  
- Status code: **400 Bad Request**  
- Response body contains an error message indicating missing or invalid input

**Notes:**  
- The API accepts an empty body and creates a product, assigning a new ID.
- This behavior violates standard REST validation expectations.
- API should reject requests with missing required fields.
- A bug report will be created to highlight this issue.
