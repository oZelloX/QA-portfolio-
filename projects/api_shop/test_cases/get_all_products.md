  "price": 109.95,
  "description": "Your perfect pack for everyday use and walks in the forest. Stash your laptop (up to 15 inches) in the padded sleeve, your everyday",

- The expected result provides a sample structure for one product as a reference.
- Each object is expected to follow the documented format.
- Rating field with nested fields rate (float) and count (integer), which is not documented in the official API specification.
- This test confirms that the structure is mostly consistent, but undocumented fields exist.
