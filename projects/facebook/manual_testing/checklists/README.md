# Facebook Registration – Checklist Documentation

📋 **Purpose**  
This checklist outlines key test coverage areas for the Facebook registration page. It consolidates positive and negative validation points, UI elements, and boundary scenarios into a concise reference format.

🔍 **How to Use**  
Each checklist item represents a testable requirement or condition. Use this document to:
- Review what has already been covered
- Identify gaps in coverage
- Trace checklist items to individual test cases where applicable

🧪 **Coverage Focus**
- Input field validation (name, phone, email, password)
- Age range enforcement with boundary and representative values
- UI and link navigation
- Equivalence partitioning & boundary value analysis
- Realistic data simulation (e.g. Cyrillic names, pasted inputs)

🧠 **Design Notes**
- Combined similar items (e.g. phone number length issues) for clarity
- Representative values (e.g. age 15, 50) used deliberately to simulate realistic entries
- Checklist kept high-level to support faster review and prioritization
