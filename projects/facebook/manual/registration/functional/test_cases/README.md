# Functional Testing ‚Äì Facebook Registration

This section contains manual test cases for the Facebook registration form.  
It focuses on verifying both valid input flows and proper handling of invalid, incomplete, or edge-case data.

## Test Coverage

- Positive flows: phone and email sign-up, Cyrillic input, valid age and gender selection
- Negative flows: empty fields, invalid formats, short/long values, reused emails
- Boundary and equivalence testing: age limits, password rules, phone variations
- Navigation checks: Create Account and Already Have an Account links

## Notes

Each test case targets a specific input or rule to isolate individual behaviors.  
Inputs and validation rules are tested independently to ensure clear failure detection.
