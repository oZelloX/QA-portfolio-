# üìã What Was Tested

This project covers manual testing of the Facebook registration page. The goal was to simulate real-world validation using structured and methodical approaches.

## üîç Coverage Strategy

The following testing techniques were applied:

- **Equivalence Partitioning & Boundary Value Analysis**  
  Age-related logic was covered using both boundary values (e.g. 13, 17, 18, 120) and representative values (e.g. 15, 50) to ensure all valid ranges are exercised.

- **Positive & Negative Scenarios**  
  Functional paths were verified with valid data, while error-handling and validations were tested using invalid, incomplete, or edge-case inputs.

- **UI/Navigation Checks**  
  Confirmed proper navigation between registration and login pages, including link behaviors.

## üß† Notable Design Decisions

- Representative values (e.g. 15 for teen range, 50 for adult range) were intentionally added in applicable test cases to ensure deeper equivalence class coverage beyond just boundaries.
- Redundant or overlapping cases were grouped for clarity (e.g. phone number length errors, password rule violations).
- Test steps were written in concise format to reflect real project documentation practices.

## üöß Future Work

This test suite focused on functional validation using both boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning. Representative values (e.g. 15, 50) were deliberately included to ensure full range coverage beyond edge conditions.

The next stage will focus on **Accessibility Testing**, including:

- **Keyboard Navigation**  
  Ensuring users can complete registration without a mouse, verifying proper tab order and visible focus indicators.

- **Screen Reader Compatibility**  
  Validating that all input fields, buttons, and error messages are announced correctly for assistive technologies.

- **Color Contrast and Visual Cues**  
  Checking visual clarity and compliance with accessibility standards (e.g. WCAG 2.1), including sufficient contrast and non-color-based indicators.

These enhancements aim to ensure an inclusive, user-friendly registration experience across all accessibility needs.




# Functional Testing ‚Äì Facebook Registration

## Scope
Functional testing of the Facebook registration page, covering validation logic, form input behavior, and navigation between screens.

## Coverage Strategy
- Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Value Analysis for age and input constraints
- Positive and negative test cases for all required fields
- Navigation and UI behavior verification

## Design Notes
- Representative values (e.g., 15, 50) were added to broaden test coverage
- Similar test cases were grouped to avoid redundancy
- Steps written in concise format to reflect typical project documentation
