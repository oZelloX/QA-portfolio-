# Accessibility Testing – Facebook Registration

This section contains accessibility test cases for the Facebook registration form, based on WCAG 2.1 (AA level).

## Test Coverage

- Keyboard navigation and logical tab order
- Screen reader compatibility for inputs, labels, and error messages
- Proper use of ARIA roles and semantic HTML landmarks
- Sufficient color contrast and non-color indicators
- Support for zoom (200%) and responsive layout (320px width)
- Placeholder use and label visibility
- Accessible and descriptive error feedback

## Notes

Test cases focus on actual accessibility behavior, not functional validation.  
Each test addresses a unique WCAG requirement to ensure the form is inclusive and usable without a mouse or visual cues.
